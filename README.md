# Civic Discourse Patterns

A collection of language commonly used in the civic tech world. Assembled from attending dozens of pitches and talks, many for very cool projects, that excelled or failed at communicating their ideas. 

## Anti-Patterns

These are words and phrases in frequent use that should be avoided or amended to better convey information.
